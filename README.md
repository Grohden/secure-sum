# Secure Sum

Do you ever wanted to securely sum two numbers without worring about someone stealing your numbers??
If yes, secure sum is for you! (otherwise you should rethink your life choices)

Note: This project is done with **RAGE** using **XGH**

## Tell me more

`Secure sum` makes the sum of two numbers secure by encrypting two numbers that will be summed 
on a remote server (remote that runs in the same machine as the client).

## Usage

Cool! now i can have my safe sum, but how do i use it?

You need to run both client and server on different terminals:

For the client: `python src/client.py`

For the server: `python src/server.py`
